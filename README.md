Demonstrating a very common filter + sort functionality with:

* Java 8 lambda functionality
* Google Guava FluentIterable and Predicates
* LambdaJ proxies
* by hand

Also a bonus:

* An enterprise Guava demonstration of how to package filters and comparators with domain classes

To play with the code, install:

* http://jdk8.java.net/lambda/
* IntelliJ IDEA 12 Community
* Configure IDEA to use the Lambda preview JDK to compile and run the project code
  (File -> Project Structure -> Project SDK and Language Level)
